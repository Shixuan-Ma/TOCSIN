        "You tell Death that you will never tire of living no matter how long you live. It makes you a bet that you will and thus grants you true immortality. You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle! Ha!\" Death snorted. \"Yes, the circle. I've seen it I don't know how many times now.\" \"It's been about thirty.\" \"Okay, so I've seen it thirty times, and each time manages to be just as beautiful as the last.\" \"How? You've lost everyone you've ever loved, seen the world blown to pieces again and again. How can you still be in love with that damn circle? You know I told you that as a joke.\" \"It doesn't matter.

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

They were long and meandering, more adventuresome than your simple afternoon stroll. We would walk, hand in hand, and observe things about our environment. It was what we loved to do. Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose.

        "Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts.

Allah is great, and has room in His kingdom for all men of the book. We fled south, my father taking our broken nation to the lands given to us by Morocco. My father knew we would have to rebuild again. He turned those harsh lands into the fertile grounds for the New Granadian empire. I was only 15 when I took my fathers throne for him.

I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action.

For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

She was ready for the next step, but she did not know what the next step was. She tried to reminisce of her time on this world, but her life stretched beyond time immemorial like a river without a source. The memories that dripped upon her were recent ones of people she recently met. An old man laid still in hospice care with his daughter close to him while holding his hand. A wife in old age smiling as her husband regaled the days of their youth. A young boy sobbing uncontrollably with his mother labored in breathing. These recent memories involved relationships of people. In these memories, people suffered from the luxury of beautiful love in an ephemeral environment. She was saddened that these memories are of people she barely knew. She had hoped in her own dying days, there",

Glaring at the box through moist eyes, she felt conflicted, a mix of sadness, anger and pain welled deep within her. She had more questions than answers and no one left to talk to. On one hand, she was rather hurt that everything that helped make her *her* could fit into such little space. On the other, she was sad that after today she would be alone again, thrown into the lion's den as",

Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo. The kitchen had these strange machines with gears and pipes that played beautiful music when he tinkered in there. The mirrors were very nice and gave her the most lovely complements when she tried on big-girl clothes. So the mystery of the third faucet tap would also be a great surprise when she tried it.

        "## Build a World Part I: Inception\n\nOkay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there are no stars, only vast, swirling nebulae? Imagine a universe where the very fabric of space is alive, pulsing with a gentle, luminescent energy. This energy coalesces into swirling clouds of gas and dust, each one unique and constantly changing. Instead of planets, there are vast, organic islands of land, floating on currents of the nebulae. Life, in this universe, takes the form of bioluminescent creatures, their bodies shimmering and pulsing like the nebulae themselves. They are interconnected, their minds forming a vast, shared consciousness, communicating through the subtle shifting patterns of their light. \n\nPerhaps the first sentient beings in this universe wouldn't be individual creatures, but rather these interconnected clouds, whispering their secrets through the swirling patterns of light. \n",

James often felt a thrill when his fingers brushed against the fabric of a coat pocket, a practiced ease in his movements. This time, however, the thrill turned to ice in his veins.  Instead of the expected wallet, his hand closed around something cold and smooth, a small, intricately carved box. He slipped it into his own pocket, the cold seeping through the fabric.  Opening the box later, he discovered not jewels, but a single, dried, withered eye, staring up at him with a malevolent, knowing gaze.  His fingers trembled, and a wave of nausea swept over him. This wasn't just a theft, it was something far darker, something he couldn't begin to comprehend. \n",

But then, the dream returns, the power, the fear, the endless cycle of life and death. You are both, and neither. And in this waking nightmare, there is only one certainty: it is always war. \n",
        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the \"The Waste Land\" by T.S. Eliot, but with a softer touch. The fragmented imagery of the mind, the sense of loss and disillusionment, are all present, but conveyed through a gentler, almost lyrical voice. The use of metaphor and simile is masterful, painting vivid pictures of the internal landscape. The piece is haunting and evocative, leaving the reader with a sense of both sadness and hope. It's a powerful exploration of the human condition and the fragility of memory. \n",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end.\" \n\nIt's a deceptively simple concept, yet the beginning can be the most daunting part of writing a story. Fear not, fellow storytellers! The secret lies in your imagination. Let a single image, a whispered phrase, or a fleeting thought ignite your creative spark. It could be a flickering candle in a dusty attic, the scent of cinnamon on a chilly night, or the rustle of leaves in a silent forest.\n\nOnce you have your seed, let it grow. Explore the world it suggests, delve into the emotions it evokes, and let the characters unfold before you. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. So, begin at the beginning, let your pen dance, and let the magic of storytelling weave its spell. \n",

Now, whispers of a new contact filled the air. The Great Navigator, a lone adventurer venturing beyond the familiar sky, had reported a strange pull, a looming shadow in the distance. Was this the fabled continent of legend, the source of untold knowledge and power? Or was it a harbinger of disaster, a collision of worlds that could shatter their fragile existence?

This being, shimmering and radiant, yearned for companionship, for something to share its brilliance with.  But in its solitude, the light grew afraid of its own immensity. It yearned for a counterpoint, a balance. \n\nOne day, the light, in its infinite desire, decided to divide itself. It split into two \u2013 one remaining pure and radiant, the other becoming the opposite: cold, dark, and still.  The light, now known as the sun, danced across the void, painting the darkness with its brilliance.  But the darkness, known as the moon, held its own, refusing to be consumed.  And so, the dance began. \n\nDay after day, the sun chased the moon across the sky, painting the world in vibrant hues and then retreating, allowing the moon to bathe it in its cool, silver light. This eternal chase, this constant interplay of light and dark, became the rhythm of the world, the very essence of life.  And so, the sun and moon, forever intertwined, became the source of the day and night, the creators of the world as we know it. \n",

        "An inanimate object comes to life at the worst possible moment. As the British advanced steadily closer, the American infantry scrambled to draw up into formed lines to defend. The musket balls were already whistling past their heads, some finding their mark, while others sang their death song through the air.  Then, with a shuddering groan, the cannon on the hillside behind them lurched to life. The crew stood frozen in shock, hands gripping their ramrods, as the cannon, a sentient being now, spun its barrel toward the British, its face contorted in a grimace of rage. The air vibrated with a fearsome, guttural roar as the cannon let loose a terrifying barrage, not at the British, but at the terrified American soldiers who had become its new target.  The British soldiers, completely bewildered, halted their advance, staring in horror as their American counterparts scrambled to escape the deadly fire raining down upon them. \n",
        "You are functionally immortal: you can die but instantly come back to life. Over the many, many years you've become jaded and bored, watching the world spin and change.  You've seen empires rise and fall, plagues and wars, the invention of the wheel, the splitting of the atom. Each new discovery, every triumph, felt hollow.  You've lived through the joy of love and the pain of loss, each experience as fleeting as a summer breeze.  Now you exist in a state of perpetual weariness, watching from a distance, detached and cynical.  You wonder if there's anything left to experience, anything that could break through the impenetrable barrier of your ennui.  Then, one day, you see something that stirs a flicker of interest within your soul. A child, eyes wide with wonder, gazing at the sunrise.  A simple act, yet it speaks of hope, a reminder that even amidst the constant cycle of life and death, there is still beauty to be found.  Perhaps, just perhaps, there's still something left for you to discover. \n",

Your mind raced, trying to make sense of this bizarre situation.

How could you possibly convince your co-workers that you weren't Michael Scott? The first step, you decided, was to act as un-Michael as possible. You would need to suppress the urge to make a \"that's what she said\" joke, or to launch into a bizarre anecdote about your childhood. You would be the calm, collected, and most importantly, *professional* version of Michael Scott.  \n",

A bit overpriced, but the location was perfect.  The previous owners, a family of five, were quiet and kept to themselves.  They didn't seem the type to build secret passageways, but there it was - a smooth, steel door behind a false bookcase in the basement. The only way I discovered it was when I tried to move some boxes and the bookcase shifted, revealing the door. Curiosity got the better of me. I pulled the door open. \n\nThe elevator was small, just enough for one person. The controls were simple: a single button with a single arrow pointing up.
